# EPL
EPL is a new interpreter programming language i've been working on, which has a tree-walk interpreter coded in python, and a bytecode interpreter which I am currently working on, in C++. EPL was originally made for the creation of a book "Creating an interpreter in python" which I worked on. EPL stands for "Easy Programming Language"
